# Artificial Neural Network with SFML

## Description
  Simple artificial neural network made in C++ that uses the SFML library for visualizing both the training process and the network itself.

## Instalation
  Right now in this current commit you must have SFML installed and set your own project with it, then copy all the files (.cpp, .h, Resources folder). You can copy the .sln also and avoid making a new project but you would still need to install SFML from their website (version used 2.6.1 64 bit).
